# wearedesigners_demo

A demo of an app that sells watches. Just a page of a particular watch. This page is fully built out of highly customizable widgets.
 Changes can be carried out either through the constants file or when creating the widget itself. I tried to use the same widget wherever possible because of the time constraint.
 This page was built with other pages of this same type in mind and you just have to change a few things instead of the whole design.

 third party dependencies:
    - Google fonts for easy font selection
    - rflutter_alert for the easy alert for the button clicks.
